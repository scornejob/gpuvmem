# Installation

1. Download or clone gpuvmem.

2. To compile GPUVMEM you will need:
- cfitsio - Usually the package is called `libcfitsio-dev`.
- casacore <= 5.4.0 (https://github.com/casacore/casacore, please make sure you have installed the github version, Ubuntu package doesn't work well since doesn't have the `put()` function). Additionally, if you are using version 5.4.0 of casacore, please compile using the flag NEWCASA=1.
- CUDA >= 9
- OpenMP

# Installation using a Singularity container

We have created a recipe to use Singularity without worrying about installing CUDA and installing libraries. The container has gpuvmem compiled and all you need to work. Additionally, you can edit the recipe and add applications that you are interested in. To use the Singularity container, follow the next steps:
```bash
# Install Singularity, in this case we will follow the Linux instructions, but to install it on MAC see: https://singularity.lbl.gov/install-mac

sudo apt install squashfs-tools
VERSION=2.5.2
wget https://github.com/singularityware/singularity/releases/download/$VERSION/singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
tar xvf singularity-$VERSION.tar.gz
cd singularity-$VERSION
./configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
sudo make install

#Now we can use Singularity to shell into the container
mkdir container # Make a directory in your workspace
singularity shell --nv shub://miguelcarcamov/container_docker:casacore.gpuvmem.9.2 #Use this command for CUDA 9.2
# singularity shell --nv shub://miguelcarcamov/container_docker:casacore.gpuvmem.10.0 #Use this command for CUDA 10.0
```
The gpuvmem binary should be in `/gpuvmem/bin`.

# Compiling
```bash
cd gpuvmem
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make -j
```

If you are using the version 5.4.0 of casacore
 ```bash
 cd gpuvmem
 mkdir build
 cd build
 cmake .. -DNEWCASA=1
 make -j
```

# Usage

Create your canvas or mod_in_0.fits with the image data in the header, typically we use a FITS CASA CLEAN dirty image of the desired object.

Create your input.dat file with the following data and change the parameters as you need:

```
noise_cut	100.5
ftol		1.0e-12
random_probability 0.0
t_telescope        2
```
# t_telescope references the following telescopes:

1. CBI2
2. ALMA
3. ATCA
4. VLA
5. SZA
6. CBI
7. EHT


# Use GPUVMEM:

```
# Framework usage

The normal flow of the program starts by creating a synthesizer, creating an optimizer, creating an objective function, and adding your terms to the objective function

All the objects must be created by their respective factory

The number of available images is determined by the -z command

Gridding can be applied both as a filter and as an input parameter

All the specializations of objects are listed in the enums

All filters can only be applied before using Synthesizer->setDevice()

The configuration of a Fi has as parameters, the index of its penalty factor (-Z), the index of the image from where the data will be calculated, and finally the index of the image where the results of the calculations will be applied.

# IMPORTANT

Remember to create the mem folder to save the FITS images

# Fixes

We have fixed the Makefile and now you can compile gpuvmem using the new version of casacore.

# TO RESTORE YOUR IMAGE PLEASE SEE CARCAMO ET AL. 2018 FOR MORE INFORMATION

- This will return a restored image: A convolution of the model image with the CLEAN BEAM + residuals (JY/BEAM)
- Residuals (JY/BEAM)

Restoring usage:
```bash
casapy --log2term --nogui -c restore_continuum_ms.py residual_folder.ms mem_model.fits restored_output
```
